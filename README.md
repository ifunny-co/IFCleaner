## What is IFcleaner?

> IFcleaner is an app made for the purpose of helping you clean your ifunny account easily. Want to go ghost and remove as much of your digital footprint as possible from that corrupt app? Then IFcleaner is for you.

## Who made IFcleaner?

> The developer of YakubBot created it. He can be found in the IFcleaner [discord server](https://discord.gg/fwF3JUHwRD)

## Can I contribute?

> Statement from the developer:
> "At the moment I'm fine with working alone but if you have the potential and knowledge and dont expect to be taught how to code android/iOS apps then sure although there will need to be trust between us first as this app is not open source at the moment"

## What was used to create IFceaner?

> IFcleaner android version was made in android studio using Java for coding the logic and XML for displaying the design. The iOS version will be made in xcode using swift (stay tuned for that)

## Is IFcleaner safe? And what proof is there?

> IFcleaner is safe all this app does is connects to ifunny servers same way ifunny does except it allows you to interact with the ifunny servers differently. If you have doubts or feel sketchy about entering in your email and password on this app then feel free to decompile the app and look at the code or use network sniffing tools like fiddler or burpsuite on your computer (or even httpcanary which is a good one for rooted android) so you can confirm that your info is not sent anywhere else but ifunny servers same way it is on ifunny. If this is all geek to you then ask someone who's literate in programming/pentesting to help you.

## Is IFcleaner free?

> IFcleaner is free and always will be. But we will accept donations as they will help in making this app better. If you're feeling generous and want to help feel free to donate [here](https://gofundme.com/IFcleaner)
